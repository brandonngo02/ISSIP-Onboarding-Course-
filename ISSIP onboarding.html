            <h3>The Centrality of Service:</h3>
            <p>Service is central to human history, connecting important concepts in business and society. Service is
                the application of resources (e.g., knowledge) for the benefit of another. It is the basis of exchange
                and at the core of value co-creation.</p>
            <p>Reference text: "All roads lead to service. As you will see, it connects you with the world, and it is
                the glue that connects important concepts in business and society." [cite: 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581,
                582, 583, 584]</p>

        <h2>Part 1: AI and Service (15 minutes)</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Foundations of AI:</h3>
            <p>AI has roots in a 1956 workshop at Dartmouth, New Hampshire. Two camps emerged: technology-centric
                automation and human-centric augmentation. Automation focuses on making more capable machines.
                Augmentation focuses on enhancing human capabilities in partnership with machines. Both camps have
                utopian advocates and dystopian critics. Progress in deep learning is a cause of the current AI summer.
                AI can improve productivity by replacing labor or enhance quality and creativity by augmenting human
                performance.</p>
            <p>Reference text: "While its roots go back further, as a field of study and community of practice,
                artificial intelligence (AI) was formally named and began at a Dartmouth, New Hampshire workshop in
                1956." [cite: 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 698, 699, 700, 701]</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Service Robots and Platform Society:</h3>
            <p>Better AI, through automation and augmentation, scales up better service by providing easier access to
                innovation. Service robots are an example of AI in service, automating tasks and providing assistance
                (e.g., Siri, Alexa, Roomba). Tele-robotics involves remote control of robots, addressing technical and
                social barriers to adoption and creating high-tech jobs. Robots in the home can reduce human labor and
                costs, which is especially important for elderly people. Smartphone apps connected to online platforms
                are a type of digital service that is increasingly common. These platforms enable interactions between
                users and are becoming essential in daily life.</p>
            <p>Reference text: “In the previous chapter, we learned that better AI, both automation and augmentation,
                cuts the cost of scaling up better service.” [cite: 199, 200, 201, 391, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688]</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Perspectives on Service (20 minutes)</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Science Perspective:</h3>
            <p>Service science studies interactions and change in complex social systems. It aims to improve
                interactions and quality of life through a deeper understanding of the world. The service innovation
                community is a growing transdiscipline, harnessing all disciplines to become better T-shaped
                professionals. Scholars in this field focus on expanding useful knowledge and building better models of
                the world. AI is helping scholars translate between disciplines to build better models.</p>
            <p>Reference text: “Service science is an emerging transdiscipline that studies interactions and change in
                complex social systems, to improve quality of life.” [cite: 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 634, 635, 636, 637,
                638, 639]</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Logic Perspective:</h3>
            <p>Service-dominant (S-D) logic focuses on how value is co-created through systems of exchange. S-D logic
                views exchange in terms of service-for-service rather than goods-for-goods or goods-for-money. Logics
                exist within the minds of people and become dominant when they improve people’s capabilities for
                interactions and outcomes. Educators help the next generation learn and share powerful ways of looking
                at the world.</p>
            <p>Reference text: “Logics exist within the minds of people and become dominant when they improve people’s
                capabilities for interactions and outcomes.” [cite: 215, 216, 217, 418, 419, 420, 421]</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Architecture Perspective:</h3>
            <p>Service-Dominant Architecture (SDA) puts the findings, logics, and processes of service science and S-D
                logic into practice. Architecture empowers actors to organize service as a transdisciplinary process of
                value co-creation. Architectures exist within the culture of organizations and become dominant when they
                improve organizations’ capabilities for adapting to change. Practitioners use their expertise to
                transform and restructure organizations.</p>
            <p>Reference text: “Service Dominant Architecture (SDA) Architectures exist within the culture of
                organizations and become dominant when they improve organizations’ capabilities for adapting to change.”

    <div class="module">
        <h2>Part 3: Service Innovation Community (10 minutes)</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Community of Practice:</h3>
            <p>A community of practice is a group of people who share common interests or concerns and develop methods
                of working and learning together to achieve common goals. The service research community is a global
                community committed to understanding daily interactions and helping people, businesses, and governments
                change in positive ways. This involves increasing the number of good days, ensuring changes help
                everyone, and avoiding unintended consequences. The International Society of Service Innovation
                Professionals (ISSIP) aims to deepen the understanding of service systems and collective intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>Reference text: "A community of practice can be defined as a group of people who share common interests
                or concerns and develop methods of working and learning together to achieve common goals." [cite: 641,
                642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650]</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>The Role of AI in Service:</h3>
            <p>AI is being infused into more and more interactions, reshaping how people get things done. There is a
                growing need for trusted, fair, unbiased, secure, and explainable AI. The shift to X+AI pairs (e.g.,
                customer + AI, employee + AI) is intended to improve interaction capabilities. Upskilling people with AI
                is required for high-skill, high-pay jobs. Human-centered design and human values are critical, focusing
                on issues like wealth, poverty, freedom, justice, and inclusion.</p>
            <p>Reference text: “AI is always in the news.” [cite: 707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714, 715, 716]</p>

        <h2>Part 4: Looking Ahead (10 minutes)</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Challenges and Opportunities:</h3>
            <p>The AI era presents both opportunities and challenges for service. It is crucial to invest wisely in
                upskilling and to build better models of the world. The goal is to create a wiser, more inclusive, and
                meaningful world, not just a smarter one. This requires addressing tough questions and replacing fear
                with understanding.</p>
            <p>Reference text: "The opportunities and challenges of service in the AI era can be best explored given a
                basic understanding of AI and science, logic, and architecture perspectives on service—hence this book."
                [cite: 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 631, 663, 664, 665, 666]</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Continuous Improvement:</h3>
            <p>Service innovation is ongoing, with a focus on improving interactions and change processes. This involves
                finding new ways for people to apply knowledge for mutual benefit and to improve quality of life and
                well-being. The service community must address challenges related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
