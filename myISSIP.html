        <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleConcept(this)">‚ñ∂Ô∏è What is Service?</button>
        <div class="concept-content">
        <ul>
          <li>Service is defined as the application of resources (e.g., knowledge) for the benefit of another.</li>
          <li> It is fundamental to social and economic exchange and lies at the core of value co-creation, which aims to make every situation more beneficial and win-win for everyone involved.</li>
          <li> Service underlies social and economic development, and the wealth of people, businesses, and nations.</li>
          <li>The service research community aims to understand daily interactions to improve outcomes for people, businesses, and governments, recognizing that great interactions create more value for all stakeholders.</li>
        </ul> 
      </div>
    </div>    
    <div class="concept-box">
      <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleConcept(this)">‚ñ∂Ô∏è Service Innovation</button>
      <div class="concept-content">
      <ul>
        <li>Service innovation involves finding new ways for people to apply knowledge for mutually beneficial interactions that improve the quality of life and well-being. </li>
        <li>It requires the integration of advanced technologies (like AI) for amplifying capabilities, innovative business models for scaling benefits, and effective institutional arrangements for mitigating harms.</li>
        <li>A key goal of service innovation is to foster improvements in interactions and drive positive change within business and society, while upholding human values (freedom, justice, inclusion), and ensuring sustainability and resilience.</li>
        <li>Service innovation also involves rebundling resources to create new resources.
        </li>

  <div class="concept-box">
    <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleConcept(this)">‚ñ∂Ô∏è üß† Activity: Service Around You</button>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p>Look around your daily life‚Äîyour morning routine, a recent purchase, or a conversation. Identify <strong>2 examples of service</strong> you received or provided. What knowledge or resource was applied? Write them down in your notes or phone.</p>
    </div>
  </div>   
  <div class="concept-box">
    <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleConcept(this)">‚ñ∂Ô∏è AI & Digital Service</button>
    <div class="concept-content">
    <ul>
      <li>AI refers to technologies that can act intelligently (like people in some ways) in real-world contexts, often by learning from data or being programmed.</li>
      <li>AI is rapidly transforming service delivery and consumption, with AI-driven tools and online platforms becoming increasingly prevalent.</li>
      <li>Technology-mediated service interactions, facilitated by digital platforms, are being reshaped by AI, leading to new opportunities and challenges.</li>
      <li>Online platforms are defined as a digital service or technology-enabled service that enables interactions between two or more distinct but interdependent sets of users (whether firms or individuals) who interact through the service via the Internet.</li>
    </ul> 
  </div>
</div>  
<div class="concept-box">
  <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleConcept(this)">‚ñ∂Ô∏è Service Practice</button>
  <div class="concept-content">
  <ul>
    <li>Service practice involves the responsible application of knowledge and skills to help others, coupled with a commitment to continuous learning (upskilling).</li>
    <li>It emphasizes value co-creation, collaboration, and ethical considerations in service interactions, all of which are becoming more critical in the AI era.  </li>
    <li>Service professionals must adapt to the evolving service landscape by expanding their skill sets and embracing AI to enhance their capabilities.  </li>
    <li>The International Society of Service Innovation Professionals (ISSIP) supports give-get-grow community engagement at all stages of career development, from student to diverse career roles to retired, to support service innovation.  </li>
